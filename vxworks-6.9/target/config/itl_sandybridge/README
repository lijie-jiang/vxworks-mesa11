          README: Intel(R) Sandy Bridge

This file contains board-specific information for Intel(R) Sandy Bridge BSP.

This BSP is very similar to the itl_nehalem BSP but also contains
additional enhancements and drivers.

This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software or hardware 
versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that must be noted before 
using this BSP.  

Additionally, the target board's reference entry (e.g., man pcXXXX for UNIX 
or the HTML reference entries) provides board-specific information necessary 
to run VxWorks.  The target reference entry should be read fully before this 
BSP is used.
